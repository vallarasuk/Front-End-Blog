          <br />
          <p>
            Before we learn what the Internet is, we need to understand what a
            Network is. A network is a group of computers or other devices which
            are connected to eachother. For example, you at your home might have
            a network of computers and devices. Your friend living next door
            might have a similar network of devices. Their neighbor might have a
            similar network of devices. All these networks when connected
            together form the internet. <br /> <br />
            The internet was developed in the late 1960s by the United States
            Department of Defense as a means of creating a decentralized
            communication network that could withstand a nuclear attack. Over
            the years, it has evolved into a complex and sophisticated network
            that spans the globe. <br /> <br />
            Today, the internet is an essential part of modern life, used by
            billions of people around the world to access information,
            communicate with friends and family, conduct business, and much
            more. As a developer, it is essential to have a solid understanding
            of how the internet works and the various technologies and protocols
            that underpin it.

          <Br />
          <p>
            At a high level, the internet works by connecting devices and
            computer systems together using a set of standardized protocols.
            These protocols define how information is exchanged between devices
            and ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely. <br />
            <Br />
            The core of the internet is a global network of interconnected
            routers, which are responsible for directing traffic between
            different devices and systems. When you send data over the internet,
            it is broken up into small packets that are sent from your device to
            a router. The router examines the packet and forwards it to the next
            router in the path towards its destination. This process continues
            until the packet reaches its final destination. <br />
            <Br />
            To ensure that packets are sent and received correctly, the internet
            uses a variety of protocols, including the Internet Protocol (IP)
            and the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). IP is responsible for
            routing packets to their correct destination, while TCP ensures that
            packets are transmitted reliably and in the correct order. <br />
            <Br />
            In addition to these core protocols, there are a wide range of other
            technologies and protocols that are used to enable communication and
            data exchange over the internet, including the Domain Name System
            (DNS), the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), and the Secure
            Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) protocol. As a
            developer, it is important to have a solid understanding of how
            these different technologies and protocols work together to enable
            communication and data exchange over the internet.

          <Br />
          <p>
            Protocols play a critical role in enabling communication and data
            exchange over the internet. A protocol is a set of rules and
            standards that define how information is exchanged between devices
            and systems. <br />
            <Br />
            There are many different protocols used in internet communication,
            including the Internet Protocol (IP), the Transmission Control
            Protocol (TCP), the User Datagram Protocol (UDP), the Domain Name
            System (DNS), and many others. <br />
            <Br />
            IP is responsible for routing packets of data to their correct
            destination, while TCP and UDP ensure that packets are transmitted
            reliably and efficiently. DNS is used to translate domain names into
            IP addresses, and HTTP is used to transfer data between clients and
            servers. <br />
            <Br />
            One of the key benefits of using standardized protocols is that they
            allow devices and systems from different manufacturers and vendors
            to communicate with each other seamlessly. For example, a web
            browser developed by one company can communicate with a web server
            developed by another company, as long as they both adhere to the
            HTTP protocol. <br />
            <Br />
            As a developer, it's important to understand the various protocols
            used in internet communication and how they work together to enable
            the transfer of data and information over the internet.

          />
          <Br />
          <p>
            IP addresses and domain names are both important concepts to
            understand when working with the internet. <br />
            <Br />
            An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a
            network. It's used to route data to the correct destination,
            ensuring that information is sent to the intended recipient. IP
            addresses are typically represented as a series of four numbers
            separated by periods, such as "192.168.1.1". <br />
            <Br />
            Domain names, on the other hand, are human-readable names used to
            identify websites and other internet resources. They're typically
            composed of two or more parts, separated by periods. For example,
            "google.com" is a domain name. Domain names are translated into IP
            addresses using the Domain Name System (DNS). <br />
            <Br />
            DNS is a critical part of the internet infrastructure, responsible
            for translating domain names into IP addresses. When you enter a
            domain name into your web browser, your computer sends a DNS query
            to a DNS server, which returns the corresponding IP address. Your
            computer then uses that IP address to connect to the website or
            other resource you've requested.
          </p>

        <br />
        <div id="http">

          <Label className={""} label={"Introduction to HTTP and HTTPS"} />
          <br />
          <p>
            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) and HTTPS (HTTP Secure) are two
            of the most commonly used protocols in internet-based applications
            and services. <br /> <Br />
            HTTP is the protocol used to transfer data between a client (such as
            a web browser) and a server (such as a website). When you visit a
            website, your web browser sends an HTTP request to the server,
            asking for the webpage or other resource you've requested. The
            server then sends an HTTP response back to the client, containing
            the requested data. <br />
            <Br />
            HTTPS is a more secure version of HTTP, which encrypts the data
            being transmitted between the client and server using SSL/TLS
            (Secure Sockets Layer/Transport Layer Security) encryption. This
            provides an additional layer of security, helping to protect
            sensitive information such as login credentials, payment
            information, and other personal data. <br />
            <Br />
            When you visit a website that uses HTTPS, your web browser will
            display a padlock icon in the address bar, indicating that the
            connection is secure. You may also see the letters "https" at the
            beginning of the website address, rather than "http".

          <br />
          <p>
            TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the
            underlying communication protocol used by most internet-based
            applications and services. It provides a reliable, ordered, and
            error-checked delivery of data between applications running on
            different devices. <br />
            When building applications with TCP/IP, there are a few key concepts
            to understand:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Ports:</span>
              <p>
                Ports are used to identify the application or service running on
                a device. Each application or service is assigned a unique port
                number, allowing data to be sent to the correct destination.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Sockets:</span>
              <p>
                A connection is established between two sockets when two devices
                want to communicate with each other. During the connection
                establishment process, the devices negotiate various parameters
                such as the maximum segment size and window size, which
                determine how data will be transmitted over the connection.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Connections:</span>
              <p>
                Once a connection is established, data can be transferred
                between the applications running on each device. Data is
                typically transmitted in segments, with each segment containing
                a sequence number and other metadata to ensure reliable
                delivery.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            When building applications with TCP/IP, you'll need to ensure that
            your application is designed to work with the appropriate ports,
            sockets, and connections. You'll also need to be familiar with the
            various protocols and standards that are commonly used with TCP/IP,
            such as HTTP, FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and SMTP (Simple Mail
            Transfer Protocol). Understanding these concepts and protocols is
            essential for building effective, scalable, and secure
            internet-based applications and services.

          <br />
          <p>
            As we discussed earlier, SSL/TLS is a protocol used to encrypt data
            being transmitted over the internet. It is commonly used to provide
            secure connections for applications such as web browsers, email
            clients, and file transfer programs. <br />
            When using SSL/TLS to secure internet communication, there are a few
            key concepts to understand:
          </p>
          <br />
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Certificates:</span>
              <p>
                {" "}
                During the SSL/TLS handshake process, the client and server
                exchange information to negotiate the encryption algorithm and
                other parameters for the secure connection.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Encryption:</span>
              <p>
                Once the secure connection is established, data is encrypted
                using the agreed-upon algorithm and can be transmitted securely
                between the client and server.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="fw-bold">Connections:</span>

            When building internet-based applications and services, it's
            important to understand how SSL/TLS works and to ensure that your
            application is designed to use SSL/TLS when transmitting sensitive
            data such as login credentials, payment information, and other
            personal data. You'll also need to ensure that you obtain and
            maintain valid SSL/TLS certificates for your servers, and that you
            follow best practices for configuring and securing your SSL/TLS
            connections. By doing so, you can help protect your users' data and
            ensure the integrity and confidentiality of your application's
            communication over the internet.
